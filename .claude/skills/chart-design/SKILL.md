  Data-driven chart generation for slide-svg decks. Renders 21 chart types
  (bar/line/area/scatter/combo/waterfall/bullet, pie/donut/gauge/radar,
  KPI cards/progress/funnel/heatmap/treemap) as native SVG fragments styled
  entirely by the ACTIVE slide-svg theme tokens — zero network calls, zero
  chart libraries, converter-safe output. Use whenever a slide needs a chart
  built from real numbers: "차트 만들어", "그래프로 보여줘", "매출 추이 시각화",
  chart_strategy values from slide_plan.json, or any quantitative evidence on a
  slide. Also use to REJECT a bad chart choice — this skill's judgment rules
  (bar-first, pie/radar gates) decide the chart type from the data shape.

# chart-design — 데이터 → 슬라이드 차트

Deterministic chart renderer for slide-svg. You describe the DATA in a small
JSON spec; the engine computes geometry (scales, ticks, arcs, squarify) and
emits a slide-ready `<g>` fragment. You never hand-draw bars or eyeball pixel
positions, and you never pick colors — style is resolved at render time from
`slide/references/theme-active.json`. When the theme changes, re-render and
every chart follows.

```
data + judgment (you) ──spec.json──▶ render_chart.py ──▶ <g> fragment ──▶ slide SVG
                                          ▲
                       slide/references/theme-active.json (active theme tokens)
```

**Hard boundaries** (violating any of these is a bug, not a style choice):

1. **No hardcoded style** — every color/font/radius/stroke in output comes from
   theme tokens. If tokens can't be read the render FAILS (`TokenResolutionError`);
   there are no fallback defaults, because a wrong-theme chart silently poisons
   a deck.
2. **No network, no chart libraries** — pure stdlib geometry. Client data never
   leaves the machine.
3. **Text stays `<text>`** — labels are real text elements (Pretendard chain from
   `typography.font-chain`), never outlined to paths, so exported PPTX text
   remains editable and Korean renders correctly.
4. **Converter-safe SVG only** — no mask/style/class/use/textPath/filters
   (shared-standards.md §1). Series colors are theme hexes + `fill-opacity`
   (the anti-slop T4 single-accent ladder), so `svg_quality_checker.py` passes
   with zero off-theme warnings.

## 1. Chart selection — decide from the data shape, not from taste

Ask: **what is the ONE thing the audience must read off this chart?**
Then map the data shape:

| Data shape / intent | Chart | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Categories compared by one metric | **`bar`** (DEFAULT) | one hero category → `options.focus` |
| Long Korean labels, ranking, 5–12 items | **`horizontal_bar`** | labels never rotate; horizontal IS the fix |
| Same categories × 2–4 series, absolute values | **`grouped_bar`** | >4 series → aggregate or split |
| Parts stacking to a meaningful total | **`stacked_bar`** | 2–4 parts; mixed signs forbidden |
| Share structure across groups (totals differ) | **`stacked_bar_100`** | only 2 parts → use `line`/`area` of the share instead |
| One metric over ≥4 time points | **`line`** | <4 points → `bar` or `kpi_cards` |
| 2–3 metrics' trajectories compared | **`multi_line`** | same unit only; different units → `combo` |
| Trend where cumulative volume matters | **`area`** | 1–2 series; more → `line` |
| Two numeric variables' relationship | **`scatter`** | both axes must be numeric |
| Quantity (bars) + rate (line), different units | **`combo`** | e.g. 매출 + 영업이익률 |
| Decomposing a change into +/− contributions | **`waterfall`** | bridge analysis, 증감 분해 |
| Actual vs target per metric | **`bullet`** | KPI 달성률 rows |
| Share of a whole, ≤5 parts | **`pie` / `donut`** | gate-enforced; donut center = total |
| Single completion rate | **`gauge`** | one number vs max |
| 5–8 dimensions, one shared scale | **`radar`** | gate-enforced |
| 1–8 headline numbers | **`kpi_cards`** | ≤3 data points? This is usually the answer |
| Per-item completion % | **`progress`** | OKR rows |
| Sequential narrowing stages, 3–5 | **`funnel`** | conversion between stages auto-annotated |
| Two categorical axes × intensity | **`heatmap`** | ≤12×14 cells |
| 3–12 items' share by area | **`treemap`** | >12 → table |

Rhetorical roles from `slide_plan.json` (`chart_strategy`) map via
[references/integration.md §3](references/integration.md).

### Negative rules (read before picking anything fancy)

The more chart types available, the stronger the pull toward the flashy one.
Resist it — these rules are enforced by the renderer where possible
(`ChartJudgmentError` names the better chart):

1. **Default is `bar`.** Any other type must be justified by the data shape
   above. "보기 좋아서" is not a justification.
2. **`pie`/`donut` only when ≤5 slices AND parts of one whole.** Otherwise
   `horizontal_bar` (sorted). Angles are the least accurate visual channel;
   never use pie for precise comparison. Negative values never.
3. **`radar` only when 5–8 axes share one scale.** Different units → normalize
   first or use `grouped_bar`. Max 3 polygons.
4. **≤3 data points → `kpi_cards`,** not a chart. A 2-bar chart is a slow
   sentence; two stat cards are a fast one.
5. **No 3D, shadows, gradients, glow, or decorative effects.** The engine never
   emits them; do not post-edit them in. (anti-slop discipline)
6. **Colors come ONLY from theme tokens.** Never specify colors in specs or
   post-edit hexes. Series = single-accent opacity ladder (T4); semantic
   green/red only when the data means gain/loss (waterfall, KPI deltas).
7. **Series cap is 4** (ladder depth). More → aggregate to top-3 + 기타.
8. **Every chart slide pairs with a takeaway** — the chart shows the shape,
   an adjacent text line states the so-what (chart-rhetorical-roles.md lock).

## 2. Usage

### Render one chart

```bash
# spec.json 작성 후 (schema: references/spec-format.md)
python3 .claude/skills/chart-design/scripts/render_chart.py spec.json -o chart_frag.svg --pos 60,220

# 미리보기 (테마 배경 포함 완전한 SVG)
python3 .claude/skills/chart-design/scripts/render_chart.py spec.json -o preview.svg --standalone

# 스펙/판단 게이트만 검사 (렌더 없이)
python3 .claude/skills/chart-design/scripts/render_chart.py spec.json --validate-only
```

Minimal spec — everything else is optional:

```json
{
  "type": "bar",
  "unit": "억",
  "width": 720, "height": 420,
  "data": [
    {"label": "서울", "value": 124},
    {"label": "부산", "value": 87}
  ],
  "options": {"focus": "서울"}
}
```

### Embed into a slide

Output is `<g id="chart_bar" data-chart-type="bar">…</g>` with **absolute slide
coordinates baked in** by `--pos X,Y` (no transform on the wrapper — the
quality checker's text scanner cannot resolve ancestor transforms). Paste the
fragment into the slide SVG body. Size the region with spec `width`/`height`;
typical content-area chart: `width 640–760, height 380–440`, positioned below
the headline block. Full embedding contract + `chart_strategy` mapping:
[references/integration.md](references/integration.md).

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `SpecError` — malformed spec | fix the JSON per references/spec-format.md |
| 3 | `TokenResolutionError` — theme unreadable | run theme-init to (re)activate a theme; NEVER hand-substitute colors |
| 4 | `ChartJudgmentError` — wrong chart for this data | the message names the correct type; restructure and re-render |

A `[chart-design] WARN:` on stderr is advisory (e.g. ≤3 points → kpi_cards
suggestion) — heed it unless the user explicitly chose otherwise.

Read `references/spec-format.md` when writing any spec beyond bar/line.
Read `references/integration.md` before embedding into a deck or when a
`chart_strategy` value arrives from slide-plan.

### After a theme change

Charts are artifacts of the theme that rendered them. After
`init_theme.py --activate <preset>`, re-render every chart spec in the deck
(specs are the source of truth; keep them next to the project) and refresh the
skill examples: `python3 .claude/skills/chart-design/scripts/build_examples.py`.
